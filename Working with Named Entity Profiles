Workstation extracts intelligence from processed data in the form of named entities. Named Entities are objects resembling a specific data pattern. Workstation extracts and indexes these values for analysis. These values are recognized from matches based on pre-defined regular expression pattern searches utilized by Workstation. Named Entities identify specific data sets and are useful for analysis as they enable information such as companies, personal IDs, names, or phone numbers to be brought to the surface of the data set. Named Entity identification and extraction takes place during processing and is extracted from item content (text), properties, or both.

Workstation has an enhanced entity model with additional flexibility and the ability to extract entity information from a set of available default regular expressions. The current default named entities available are Company, Credit Card, Personal ID, Email, Money, Person, Phone Number, Country, IP Address, URL.
